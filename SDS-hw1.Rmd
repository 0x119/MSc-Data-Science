## Question 1
My assumptions are that Rome has population of 1,486,981 people, and one phone number is available per 4 people (avg family) + one phone number per 1,000 people for other stuff like businesses or government. 

Line busyness is a normal random variable with mean 0.2 and sd 0.1.

```{r}
pop = 1486981
totalNumbers = pop / 4 +  pop /1000 
probBusy = rnorm(1,0.2,0.1)
prior = 1 / totalNumbers
post = 1 / (totalNumbers*probBusy)
cat("My belief was", prior, "\n")
cat("My belief after dialing is", post, "\n")
cat("Therefore my belief increased by", post/prior, "times")
```
